# SD-AEI
An advanced encryption technique for images with SD-AEI method
# code explanation: 
First, each pixel changed to the corresponding eight bit binary number, we used 8 bits because of the normal 8 bit password length. Then, advanced hill cipher technique is implemented by using involutory matrix. Finally, image file is randomize multiple times- which is depends on the password provided for encryption- with MSA randomization encryption method.


The code is implemented in c++ and OpenCV over famouse pictures such as Lenna, cameraman and etc.
