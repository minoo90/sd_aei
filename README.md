# SD-AEI
An advanced encryption technique for images with SD-AEI method
# code explanation: 

First, each pixel is transformed into its corresponding eight-bit binary number. Then, the advanced hill cipher technique is implemented by using involutory matrix. Finally, the image file is randomized multiple times— which depends on the password provided for encryption— with the MSA randomization encryption method. 
The code is implemented in C++ and OpenCV over famous pictures such as Lenna, Cameraman, etc.
